DS Assignment #3

Rewrite assignment #1 to use the most appropriate STL containers instead of the linked lists.

You should use your code for Assignment #1 for this (but you are not required to do so) but you will have to remove all code that is not relevant to this assignment.

Requirements

Your code must work to the functional requirements of Assignment #1 with the addition of:
the output must have one song on each line
the output must be sorted by song title
You must choose the most appropriate STL containers. Choosing a signficantly less appropriate one will cause you to lose marks.
Take out all linked list code.
Do not leave in debugging output.
Other Requirements

Your program must compile without warnings. If you have to use a #pragma as stated in the C course notes in order to get rid of the Microsoft-specific warnings, you should do so.
Your executable must be named dsA3.exe (renamed to dsA3.x).
The source file that contains your main() function must be called dsA3.cpp.
If you want to create other source files, name them appropriately.
Remember to put appropriate header comments at the top of ALL source files.
Your code must meet the code standards specified in class, this semester and in the C course last semester.
If you did not take the C course, it is your responsiblility to read the C course notes and C assignment requirements so that you know what is expected.
Submit your source code and renamed executable to the appropriate D2L dropbox.
Hints

You must use C++ since the STL is not available in C.
